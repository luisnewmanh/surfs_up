# Election Analysis
## Overview of Project
Analyze Oahu weather data to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a good investment.
### Purpose
Analyze the data and create digestable dataframes and visualizations that helps understanding the weather in Oahu; emphasis will be put in June and December to conclude if the pruposed business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
### Yearly Temperatures

- On average there is a 3.9 degrees drop in December compared to June; on the same token there is more temperature variation in December.
- It can be seen that the minimum temperature is 56 degrees in December as compared to 64 degrees in June, it would be interesting to check at which time this minimum temperature was captured.
- During December 75% of the time there will be temperatures over 69 degrees, while 25% of the time during June they will be over 73 degrees 
## Summary
After analyzing June and December temperatures it can be said that a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is a low risk investment. Further information is needed to complete a well rounded analysis, is December the coldest month? What about the precipitation? 

1. A historic temperature average for each month to determine the coldest month, followed by a temperature summary.
2. A full evaluation of the precipitation should be done, understanding if it is save to surf under precipitating conditions will round up the analysis.
